<h1>Hello this website is for my brothers Tosin and Toni just to make you happy because I <b> care about you.</b> </h1>
<hr>
<h2>

You guys are very important to me and I care you so much, I'm sorry for the times we get angry at each other and I hope you don't think of me as a bad brother you guys are really <ins> special and important</ins> to me. I hope you know that and my promise is that every time you thought something was ufair from now on I will either give you Attic Ruler title or play ranked with you or last of all let you play a game of your choice on ps4. You mean a <em> lot</em> to me and I don't like you being upset at me and I'm sorry for the times I get mad at you. Remember though I am not a Robot I am a human as well so please treat me like one. One thing I think you should change Tosin stop getting mad for little things and Toni stop being annoying on <del> perpose</del> purpose. Sometimes though  you make me feel <b> proud</b> and be the way you <mark> are</mark> and that is all.
And last of all lets do what you suggested.
